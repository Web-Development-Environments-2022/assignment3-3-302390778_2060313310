      <h2><strong> ingridenes</strong></h2>
      <br>
        <p>
        ¼ cup olive oil <br>
        ½ cup yellow onions, minced <br>
        2 teaspoons minced garlic <br>
        6 ounces tomato paste <br>
        7 cups crushed canned tomatoes, Cento or San Marzano <br>
        2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning <br>
        ½ teaspoon black pepper <br>
        2 pounds ground beef, 80% to 90% lean meat <br>
        2 large eggs <br>
        1 cup breadcrumbs, plain or Italian-style <br>
        ½ cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated, plus more for garnish <br>
        ½ cup yellow onion, finely minced <br>
        2 teaspoons kosher salt <br>
        1 teaspoon black pepper <br>
        1 teaspoon Italian seasonings, omit if using Italian-style breadcrumbs <br>
        1 teaspoon minced garlic <br>
        ¼ cup sliced basil, for garnish 
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2><strong> instructions</strong></h2>
        <p>
          1. Fill large pot w/ about two gallons of water. Bring to a boil, add chicken and about half of the carrots <br>
           and all of the celery to the pot. Lower heat to a simmer, let cook for about 45 minutes. <br>
            Carefully remove chicken and place on cutting board, let cool for a few minutes. <br>
            <br>
          2. Meanwhile, scoop up enough boiled carrots and celery and place them into a blender. <br>
           Fill blender about two-thirds of the way up. Puree vegetables, then return the blend to the pot. <br>
            <br>
          3 Debone chicken and chop up large chunks of meat. Return chicken and large bones to pot, <br>
           discard smaller bones. Add remaining carrots. Simmer for another hour, adding extra stock as water level drops. <br>
            Salt and pepper to taste. <br>
            <br>
          4. Whip up the whites of the four eggs until they become frothy (the more you whip, <br>
           the fluffier your kneidlach will be). Add oil and egg yolks, whip some more. <br>
            Incorporate matzah meal and one teaspoon of salt and pepper each. <br>
            If you like firm kneidlach, place the batter in a refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes. <br>
             If you like them really light (floaters), skip the fridge and go to the next step. <br>
            <br>
          5. Scoop a small sample of mixture (less than a teaspoon) and drop into boiling water or soup. <br>
           After several minutes, remove the test kneidlach and taste. Add more salt and pepper to the entire mixture, <br>
            if desired. Or, if you trust my recipe, skip the test and move on. <br>
            <br>
          6. To make the kneidlach, wet your hands with water to keep your fingers from sticking. <br>
           Then, make matzah balls about one inch in diameter by rolling a scoops of mixture in your hands. <br>
            Drop balls into liquid, then cook for at least 30 minutes. The kneidlach should double in size if all goes well.
